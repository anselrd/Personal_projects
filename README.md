This is my first repository. lockers.c was a C project that solves a word problem. I wrote it about a month after I first 
learned to code so it's not very robust. here is the problem:

In a school there are 1000 lockers and 1000 students. All the lockers are 
closed. The principle has the first student go to each locker and open it. Then he has the second student go to every 2nd locker and close it. Then he has the 
third student go to every third locker and close it if it's open or open it if 
it's closed. He does the same for each of the thousand students. How many 
lockers are open when all the students have gone?

The code doesn't handle the problem very efficiently, off the top of my head it seems like it runs on O(n^2) time.
